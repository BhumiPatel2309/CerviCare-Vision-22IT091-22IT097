    <h2>About Cervical Cancer Detection</h2>
    <p>Cervical cancer is a significant health concern for women worldwide, with early detection playing a critical role in successful treatment and prevention. One of the key factors in cervical cancer detection is determining the type of cervix. The cervix, the lower part of the uterus, varies in shape and structure among women, and these variations can influence the risk of developing cervical cancer.</p>

    <div class="section">
    <h2>Why Determining the Cervix Type Matters</h2>
    <p><b>Tailored Screening Methods:</b> Different cervix types may require specific screening methods to ensure accurate detection. For instance, women with a cervix that is more difficult to visualize may need alternative examination techniques to ensure that any abnormalities are not missed.</p>
    <p><b>Risk Assessment:</b> Certain types of cervix may be more prone to developing pre-cancerous changes or cervical cancer. By identifying the cervix type, healthcare providers can better assess an individual's risk level and recommend appropriate follow-up care or preventive measures.</p>
    <p><b>Personalized Treatment Plans:</b> If cervical abnormalities or cancer are detected, understanding the cervix type helps in planning personalized treatment. For example, surgical approaches may differ depending on the cervixâ€™s anatomy, ensuring that the treatment is both effective and minimally invasive.</p>
    <p><b>Improving Patient Outcomes:</b> Early and accurate detection of cervical abnormalities is key to preventing the progression of the disease. By identifying the type of cervix, healthcare providers can enhance the precision of screening and diagnostic procedures, leading to better patient outcomes.</p>
