Cervical cancer is the fourth most prevalent cancer among women globally, with increasing incidence and mortality rates, particularly in developing countries. This rise is attributed to limited screening facilities, a shortage of skilled professionals, and a lack of awareness. Traditional screening methods, including Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA), Papanicolaou (Pap) test, human papillomavirus (HPV) test, and histopathology, are subject to inter- and intra-observer variability, often leading to misdiagnosis. To address these challenges, this study presents the development of an integrated and robust system for automatic cervix type detection using deep learning techniques. The proposed system aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, potentially reducing the burden of cervical cancer by providing a reliable tool for early detection and proper classification of cervix types.
